"""Timeline analysis scaffolding.

This module sketches the interfaces we will need once the engine starts
reasoning about sequences (notes, chords, automation) across time.  The
implementation is intentionally left as TODOs so we can layer features
incrementally without derailing the current pitch-class work.

TODO:
    - Wire TimedEvent ingestion to MIDI/MusicXML readers.
    - Track harmonic context windows for compatibility checks.
    - Attach meter/tempo metadata for rhythmic analysis.
    - Surface generative hooks for phrase/voice-leading synthesis.
