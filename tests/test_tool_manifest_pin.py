"""Security gate P0.1 — the MCP tool manifest is pinned (rug-pull prevention).

**Tool metadata is executable intent.** An LLM reads a tool's name, signature and
description and acts on them, so those strings are a *trust surface*, not
documentation — the MCP-specific attack class the security-hardening brief names
(tool poisoning / shadowing / **rug pulls**, where a tool's description changes
after review). Output is already pinned by the conformance golden; this pins the
*metadata*, which nothing covered before.

Two gates:

1. **The pin.** ``golden/tool_manifest.json`` stores, per tool, its **name +
   signature + full docstring** — deliberately the *whole text*, not just a hash,
   so a description change lands as a **readable diff in review**. A bare hash
   would tell you *that* something moved, never *what*; the brief's requirement
   is that "a description change gets the same review weight as a code change,"
   and that only works if a reviewer can read it. (A digest is stored too, as a
   cheap whole-manifest fingerprint.)
2. **The instruction-language lint.** A description *describes*; it never
   *directs*. The patterns below target **second-person imperatives aimed at the
   model** ("ignore previous…", "always call…", "your instructions") rather than
   the bare words *never/always*, which this codebase uses constantly and
   legitimately to describe engine behaviour ("never guessed", "never a
   verdict"). Calibrated: the targeted set flags **0** of the current tools, while
   a naive ``never|always`` check would wrongly flag 14 — a lint that cries wolf
   gets disabled, so it is scoped to the real signal.

Intended friction, stated plainly: an intentional docstring edit now requires a
pin regen **in the same PR** — exactly as an intended output change requires a
golden regen. Regenerate with (from the repo root):

    PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python3.13 tests/test_tool_manifest_pin.py --regenerate

and **read the diff before committing it**.
